## What is GSoC?

GSoC (Google Summer of Code) is an international program that motivates developers to contribute to open-source projects. Google awards stipends for contributors who
successfully complete the GSoC program. GSoc contributors typically work on open-source development tasks under the guidance of organization mentors. Read more details about GSoC from the [official website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).

### Make Neutralinojs compatible with older Windows versions

Issue: https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralinojs/issues/486

Neutralinojs is tested on Windows 10 and 11, but it is not well-tested 
with previous Windows versions. The goal of this idea is to update Neutralinojs framework
source, build scripts, and DevOps workflow to officially support older Windows versions.

Areas: Windows API, DevOps, and Configuration

Difficulty rating: Medium

Project size: ~350h

### Support Unicode characters in Neutralinojs Windows version

Issue: https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralinojs/issues/613

Unicode characters work without any issue on Neutralinojs Linux and macOS versions. But, 
Neutralinojs Windows version doesn't render Unicode characters correctly.
The goal of this task is to use Windows Unicode APIs and fully support Unicode in the Neutralinojs Windows version.

Areas: Windows API, Refactoring, and Text Encoding

Difficulty rating: Medium

Project size: ~350h

### Fix os.setTray function problem for older macOS versions

Issue: https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralinojs/issues/615

The os.setTray function fails on macOS Catalina and some other versions.
The goal of this task to debug the Neutralinojs macOS binary on different macOS versions and 
apply a generic solution.

Areas: Cocoa API and Debugging

Difficulty rating: Medium

Project size: ~350h

### Adding opacity setting to the configuration

Issue: https://github.com/neutralinojs/roadmap/issues/1

Add the `opacity` option to the configuration to control the webview's opacity on all supported platforms. When the setting is set to `0`, and the 
CSS background also has `opacity` as `0`, the user should be able to see through the window clearly. For other opacity values, the transparency value needs to be applied accordingly.

Areas: GTK, Cocoa, Win32 APIs

Difficulty rating: Hard

Project size: ~350h

### NodeNeutralino: a community project to explain Neutralinojs custom backends

The goal is to create a sample wrapper project to guide developers to use a Node.js backend for a Neutralinojs app with
the extension API. This project will use Neutralinojs via Node.js child process API and communicate with the Neutralinojs extension API.

Areas: Node.js and Neutralinojs

Difficulty rating: Easy

Project size: ~175h

### C++/JavaScript integration test system enhancements

Issue: https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralinojs/issues/706

Neutralinojs project has a integration test suite for testing both C++ and JavaScript code at once. Currently, Neutralinojs integration tests covers minimal tests 
to detect possible function breakdowns. The goal of this task is to write a complete test suite covering all aspects of Neutralinojs APIs and global variables. Also, we expect to run the test suite on Windows CI instance too.

Areas: Neutralinojs, Unit/Integration testing, Node.js and GitHub Actions

Difficulty rating: Medium

Project size: ~350h

### Writing a test suite for the Neutralinojs CLI

Issue: https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralinojs-cli/issues/95

The goal is to create a complete test suite for Neutralinojs CLI similar to the Neutralinojs [framework integration test suite](https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralinojs/tree/main/spec). The suggested approach is to invoke CLI commands with the Node.js child process API and test Neutralinojs CLI's behavior (asserting command output, exit codes, file updates, etc.). We expect to implement Mocha tests for all CLI commands and options.

Areas: Node.js, Mocha, Testing and Neutralinojs

Difficulty rating: Easy

Project size: ~175h
